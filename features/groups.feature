Feature: Imbo provides a groups endpoint
    In order to query resource groups
    As an HTTP Client
    I want to make requests against the groups endpoint

    Background:
        Given Imbo uses the "access-control.php" configuration

    Scenario: Fetch list of groups
        Given I use "valid-group-pubkey" and "foobar" for public and private keys
        And I include an access token in the query string
        When I request "/groups.json"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the "Content-Type" response header is "application/json"
        And the response body contains JSON:
            """
            {
              "search":
              {
                "hits":2,
                "page":1,
                "limit":20,
                "count":2
              },
              "groups":
              [
                {
                  "name":"images-read",
                  "resources": ["images.get","images.head"]
                },
                {
                  "name":"groups-read",
                  "resources": ["group.get","group.head","groups.get","groups.head"]
                }
              ]
            }
            """

    Scenario Outline: Fetch a list of groups with limit + paging
        Given I use "valid-group-pubkey" and "foobar" for public and private keys
        And I include an access token in the query string
        When I request "/groups.json?limit=1&page=<page>"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the response body is:
            """
            <response>
            """

        Examples:
            | page | response |
            | 1    | {"search":{"hits":2,"page":1,"limit":1,"count":1},"groups":[{"name":"images-read","resources":["images.get","images.head"]}]} |
            | 2    | {"search":{"hits":2,"page":2,"limit":1,"count":1},"groups":[{"name":"groups-read","resources":["group.get","group.head","groups.get","groups.head"]}]} |

    Scenario: Fetch list of groups from MongoDB access control adapter
        Given Imbo uses the "access-control-mutable.php" configuration
        And I prime the database with "access-control-mutable.php"
        And I use "acl-creator" and "someprivkey" for public and private keys
        And I include an access token in the query string
        When I request "/groups.json?limit=2"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the response body is:
            """
            {"search":{"hits":3,"page":1,"limit":2,"count":2},"groups":[{"name":"existing-group","resources":["group.get","group.head"]},{"name":"user-stats","resources":["user.get","user.head"]}]}
            """

    Scenario: Fetch list of groups without specifying a public key
        When I request "/groups.json"
        Then the response status line is "400 Permission denied (public key)"
