Feature: Imbo enables client caching using related response headers
    In order to be able to cache resources
    As an HTTP Client
    I can make look at the cache-related response headers set by Imbo

    Background:
        Given "tests/Imbo/Fixtures/image1.png" exists in Imbo with identifier "fc7d2d06993047a0b5056e8fac4462a2"

    Scenario: Request status information (not cacheable)
        When I request "/status"
        Then the response is not cacheable
        And the following response headers should not be present:
        """
        last-modified
        etag
        """

    Scenario: Request user information
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request "/users/publickey"
        Then the response is cacheable

    Scenario: Request user images
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request "/users/publickey/images"
        Then the response is cacheable

    Scenario: Request user image
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And I include an access token in the query
        And the "Accept" request header is "image/*"
        When I request "/users/publickey/images/fc7d2d06993047a0b5056e8fac4462a2"
        Then the response is cacheable

    Scenario: Request user image metadata
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request "/users/publickey/images/fc7d2d06993047a0b5056e8fac4462a2/meta"
        Then the response is cacheable
