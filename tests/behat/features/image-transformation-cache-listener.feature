Feature: Imbo enables caching of transformations
    In order to speed up image transformations
    As an image server
    I will cache and re-use transformed images

    Background:
        Given Imbo uses the "image-transformation-cache.php" configuration
        And I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And "tests/phpunit/Fixtures/image1.png" is used as the test image for the "transformation cache" feature

    Scenario: Fetch uncached image, then fetch same image from cache
        Given I include an access token in the query
        When I request the test image as a "jpg"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the "Content-Type" response header is "image/jpeg"
        And the "X-Imbo-TransformationCache" response header is "Miss"
        When I request the test image as a "jpg"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the "Content-Type" response header is "image/jpeg"
        And the "X-Imbo-TransformationCache" response header is "Hit"

    Scenario: Fetch the same image, but with a different extension
        Given I include an access token in the query
        When I request the test image as a "png"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the "Content-Type" response header is "image/png"
        And the "X-Imbo-TransformationCache" response header is "Miss"
        And the checksum of the image is "fc7d2d06993047a0b5056e8fac4462a2"
        When I request the test image as a "png"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the "Content-Type" response header is "image/png"
        And the "X-Imbo-TransformationCache" response header is "Hit"
        And the checksum of the image is "fc7d2d06993047a0b5056e8fac4462a2"

    Scenario: Fetch image with extra transformations added
        Given I include an access token in the query
        And I specify "crop:width=50,height=60,x=1,y=10" as transformation
        When I request the test image as a "jpg"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the "Content-Type" response header is "image/jpeg"
        And the "X-Imbo-TransformationCache" response header is "Miss"
        And the width of the image is "50"
        And the height of the image is "60"
        When I request the test image as a "jpg"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the "Content-Type" response header is "image/jpeg"
        And the "X-Imbo-TransformationCache" response header is "Hit"
        And the width of the image is "50"
        And the height of the image is "60"

    Scenario: Delete an image, which will also delete the transformed images from the cache
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And I sign the request
        When I request the test image using HTTP "DELETE"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        When I include an access token in the query
        And I request the test image as a "jpg"
        Then the response status line is "404 Image not found"
