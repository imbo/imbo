Feature: Imbo provides a metadata endpoint
    In order to handle metadata
    As an HTTP Client
    I want to make requests against the metadata endpoint

    Background:
        Given "tests/phpunit/Fixtures/image1.png" exists for user "user"
        And I use "publicKey" and "privateKey" for public and private keys

    Scenario: Get metadata when image has no metadata attached
        When I request:
