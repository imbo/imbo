Feature: Imbo provides an event listener that generates variations when adding images
    In order to speed up scaling transformations
    As a developer
    I can add the event listener to the Imbo configuration file

    Background:
        Given Imbo uses the "image-variations.php" configuration
        And "tests/phpunit/Fixtures/1024x256.png" exists in Imbo

    Scenario: Request an image with no transformations
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And Imbo uses the "image-variations.php" configuration
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request the previously added image as a "png"
        Then I should get a response with "200 OK"
        And the "X-Imbo-ImageVariation" response header does not exist

    Scenario: Request an image with no scaling transformations
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And Imbo uses the "image-variations.php" configuration
        And I specify "desaturate" as transformation
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request the previously added image as a "png"
        Then I should get a response with "200 OK"
        And the "X-Imbo-ImageVariation" response header does not exist

    Scenario: Request an image with a resize transformation which upscales the original
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And Imbo uses the "image-variations.php" configuration
        And I specify "resize:width=2048" as transformation
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request the previously added image as a "png"
        Then the "X-Imbo-ImageVariation" response header does not exist
        And the width of the image is "2048"

    Scenario: Request an image with a maxSize transformation which downscales the original
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And Imbo uses the "image-variations.php" configuration
        And I specify "maxSize:width=320" as transformation
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request the previously added image as a "png"
        Then I should get a response with "200 OK"
        And the "X-Imbo-ImageVariation" response header matches "320x80"
        And the width of the image is "320"

    Scenario: Request an image with a maxSize transformation which only slightly downscales the original
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And Imbo uses the "image-variations.php" configuration
        And I specify "maxSize:width=1020" as transformation
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request the previously added image as a "png"
        Then I should get a response with "200 OK"
        And the "X-Imbo-ImageVariation" response header does not exist
        And the width of the image is "1020"

    Scenario: Request an image with a thumbnail transformation using inset mode and no width
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And Imbo uses the "image-variations.php" configuration
        And I specify "thumbnail:height=128,fit=inset" as transformation
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request the previously added image as a "png"
        Then I should get a response with "200 OK"
        And the "X-Imbo-ImageVariation" response header matches "512x128"
        And the width of the image is "50"

    Scenario: Request an image with a maxSize and border transformation
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And Imbo uses the "image-variations.php" configuration
        And I specify the following transformations:
          """
          crop:width=256,height=256,x=768,y=0
          maxSize:width=100
          """
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request the previously added image as a "png"
        Then I should get a response with "200 OK"
        And the "X-Imbo-ImageVariation" response header matches "512x128"
        And the pixel at coordinate "5, 5" should have a color of "#215d10"
        And the width of the image is "100"
        And the height of the image is "100"
