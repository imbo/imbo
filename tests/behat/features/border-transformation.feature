Feature: Imbo can apply border to images
    In order to apply a border to an image
    As an HTTP Client
    I can use the border transformation

    Background:
        Given "tests/phpunit/Fixtures/transparency.png" is used as the test image for the "border" feature

    Scenario: Apply an outbound border to only top/bottom
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And I specify "border:color=bf1942,height=100,width=0,mode=outbound" as transformation
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request the test image as a "png"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the width of the image is "512"
        And the height of the image is "712"
        And the pixel at coordinate "0,0" should have a color of "#bf1942"
        And the pixel at coordinate "64,164" should have a color of "#225d10"
        And the pixel at coordinate "0,164" should have a color of "#225d10"
        And the pixel at coordinate "64,662" should have a color of "#bf1942"
        And the pixel at coordinate "448,292" should have a color of "#588e00"
        And the pixel at coordinate "448,292" should have an alpha of "1"
        And the pixel at coordinate "192,164" should have an alpha of "0"

    Scenario: Apply an outbound border to an image without an alpha channel
        Given "tests/phpunit/Fixtures/512x512.png" is used as the test image
        And I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And I specify "border:color=bf1942,height=100,width=0,mode=outbound" as transformation
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request the test image as a "png"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the width of the image is "512"
        And the height of the image is "712"
        And the pixel at coordinate "0,0" should have a color of "#bf1942"
        And the pixel at coordinate "64,164" should have a color of "#225d10"
        And the pixel at coordinate "0,164" should have a color of "#225d10"
        And the pixel at coordinate "64,662" should have a color of "#bf1942"
        And the pixel at coordinate "448,292" should have a color of "#588e00"

    Scenario: Apply an inline border
        Given I use "publickey" and "privatekey" for public and private keys
        And I specify "border:color=bf1942,height=100,width=100,mode=inline" as transformation
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request the test image as a "png"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the width of the image is "512"
        And the height of the image is "512"
        And the pixel at coordinate "0,0" should have a color of "#bf1942"
        And the pixel at coordinate "114,114" should have a color of "#225d10"
        And the pixel at coordinate "340,115" should have a color of "#95c400"
        And the pixel at coordinate "100,411" should have a color of "#588e00"
        And the pixel at coordinate "382,411" should have a color of "#95c400"
        And the pixel at coordinate "413,413" should have a color of "#bf1942"
