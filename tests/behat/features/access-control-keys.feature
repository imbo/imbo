Feature: Imbo provides a keys endpoint
    In order to query public keys
    As an HTTP Client
    I want to make requests against the keys endpoint

    Background:
        Given Imbo uses the "access-control-mutable.php" configuration
        And I prime the database with "access-control-mutable.php"

    Scenario Outline: Fetch access control rules for a public key
        Given I use "master-pubkey" and "master-privkey" for public and private keys
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request "/keys/master-pubkey/access.<extension>"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the "Content-Type" response header is "<content-type>"
        And the response body matches:
        """
        <response>
        """
        Examples:
            | extension | content-type     | response |
            | json      | application/json | #^\[{"id":".*?","resources":\["keys\.put","keys\.head","keys\.delete","accessrule\.get","accessrule\.head","accessrule\.delete","accessrules\.get","accessrules\.head","accessrules\.post"],"users":\[]},{"id":".*?","group":"something","users":\["some-user"]}]$# |

    Scenario Outline: Fetch access control rules for a public key that has access to all users
        Given I use "master-pubkey" and "master-privkey" for public and private keys
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request "/keys/wildcarded/access.<extension>"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the "Content-Type" response header is "<content-type>"
        And the response body matches:
        """
        <response>
        """
        Examples:
            | extension | content-type     | response |
            | json      | application/json | #^\[{"id":".*?","group":"user-stats","users":"\*"}\]$# |

    Scenario Outline: Fetch access control rules with expanded groups
        Given I use "master-pubkey" and "master-privkey" for public and private keys
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request "/keys/group-based/access.<extension>?expandGroups=1"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the "Content-Type" response header is "<content-type>"
        And the response body matches:
        """
        <response>
        """
        Examples:
            | extension | content-type     | response |
            | json      | application/json | #^\[{"id":".*?","group":"user-stats","users":\["user1"\],"resources":\["user\.get","user\.head"]}]$# |

    Scenario: Create a public key
        Given I use "master-pubkey" and "master-privkey" for public and private keys
        And the request body contains:
        """
        {"privateKey":"the-private-key"}
        """
        And I sign the request
        When I request "/keys/the-public-key" using HTTP "PUT"
        Then the response status line is "201 Created"

    Scenario Outline: Check if a public key exist
        Given I use "acl-creator" and "someprivkey" for public and private keys
        And I include an access token in the query
        When I request "/keys/<pubkey>" using HTTP "HEAD"
        Then the response status line is "<status>"
        Examples:
            | pubkey       | status                   |
            | foobar       | 200 OK                   |
            | non-existant | 404 Public key not found |

    Scenario: Update the private key for an existing public key
        Given I use "master-pubkey" and "master-privkey" for public and private keys
        And the request body contains:
        """
        {"privateKey":"new-private-key"}
        """
        And I sign the request
        When I request "/keys/master-pubkey" using HTTP "PUT"
        Then the response status line is "200 OK"

    Scenario: Create new public key without having access to the keys resource
        Given I use "foobar" and "barfoo" for public and private keys
        And the request body contains:
        """
        {"privateKey":"moo"}
        """
        And I sign the request
        When I request "/keys/some-new-pubkey" using HTTP "PUT"
        Then the response status line is "400 Permission denied (public key)"

    Scenario Outline: Add access rules for a public key
        Given I use "master-pubkey" and "master-privkey" for public and private keys
        And the request body contains:
        """
        <body>
        """
        And I sign the request
        When I request "/keys/foobar/access" using HTTP "POST"
        Then the response status line is "<status>"
        Examples:
