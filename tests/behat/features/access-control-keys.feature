Feature: Imbo provides a keys endpoint
    In order to query public keys
    As an HTTP Client
    I want to make requests against the keys endpoint

    Background:
        Given Imbo uses the "access-control-mutable.php" configuration
        And I prime the database with "access-control-mutable.php"

    Scenario: Fetch access control rules for a public key

        Then the response status line is "200 OK"
        And the "Content-Type" response header is "application/json"
        And the response body contains JSON:
