// Router for the built in httpd in php-5.4. Route everything through index.php. When ran from the
//  base project directory, the command looks like this:
//
// php -S localhost:8888 -t public tests/router.php

if (file_exists($_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'])) {
    // The file exists, serve the file as is
    return false;
}

// Imbo uses SCRIPT_FILENAME for path resolution, so set that to the expected value
$_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'] = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . '/index.php';
