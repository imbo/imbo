# Imbo

Imbo is an application that can add/get/delete/transform images using a RESTful interface.

The main idea behind Imbo is to have a place to store high quality original images and to use the REST interface to fetch variations of those images. Imbo will resize, rotate, crop (amongst many other transformations) on the fly so you won't have to store all the different variations.
